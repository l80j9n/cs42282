Introduction:   This assignment aims to test thestudent'sunderstanding of   per unit calculation,   steady-state   analysis   and   modelling   of synchronous   generator.The   assignment   deadline   is   available on Canvas.
Q1(Per Unit Calculation and Steady-State Analvsis)
Consider   a   2   polesynchronous   generator   rated   at   500   MVA,20   kV,50   Hz   and   0.88   power   factor with 3 phase stator windings.The inductances andresistances associated with the   stator   and field windings are listed   as   follows:

a. Please    calculate      the      values      forL       ,L₄,L/and    L      in    henrys.
b. With the machine rated values as base values for stator quantities,please calculate   the base   values for other statorand rotor   quantities.
c. Using   the   calculated   base   values   from   b,calculatethe   per   unit   values   of   the   following   according   to   the   L   -base   per   unit   system:


d. Consider   damper   windings    on   the    d-and      q-axes   with   their   per  代 写Steady-State Analvsis
代做程序编程语言 unit    inductances    and   resistances   shown   in(3)and   assume   that   L   is   equal   to   L:

If the   generator   is   delivering   rated   MVA   at   0.92   power   factor   (lag)and   rated   terminal   voltage,please calculatetheinternal angleδ in degrees and the per unit values offollowing   electrical variables:

Q2 (dg0 transform)
Consider   the   following   three-phase positive   sequence   currentswith   frequency   of 60   Hz:


a. Please    calculate    the    corresponding    values    ofi,andi,if    the    rotating      dqO      frame's      d-axis      is   aligned with phase A   axis   at   time   zero.
b. Please   implement   dqO   transformation   of   three-phase   currents   in(5)using   SIMULINK   and   validate your   answer   in   a.
c. What   are   the   values   ofi,andi,if   d-axis   is   leading   the   phase   A   axis   by   90   degrees   at   time   zero?Calculate   the   result   using   SIMULINK   and   explain   it.
